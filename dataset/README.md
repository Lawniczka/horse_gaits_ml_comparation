# Horse Action Recognition Dataset (External Resource)

This directory refers to an **external dataset repository** used in the context of this thesis for the purpose of visual analysis and classification of equine gait patterns.

The dataset itself is **not included** in this repository, as it is not available to the public as of 07/01/2026.

More information on ways to acquire the dataset can be found here: [Horse Action Recognition Dataset](https://github.com/kotokamatsunaga/horsedataset)

## Dataset Description

The **Horse Action Recognition Dataset** is a curated collection of image sequences depicting horses performing fundamental locomotion patterns. It has been designed to support research in **computer vision**, **action recognition**, and **machine learning–based gait analysis**.

Each sample in the dataset is annotated with one of three canonical horse gaits:

- **Walk** — a four-beat gait characterized by sequential limb movement and continuous ground contact.
- **Trot** — a two-beat gait in which diagonal pairs of limbs move synchronously.
- **Canter** — a three-beat asymmetric gait with a distinct lead leg and suspension phase.

These gait categories correspond to biomechanically meaningful motion patterns commonly used in both veterinary science and equine biomechanics.
